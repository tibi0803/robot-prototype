"flowchart"

follow the line
keep track of the location (odometry based combined with counting the corners?)
find the boxes(1 at a time)
identify box color
pick up the box
follow the line and keep track of location 
identify destination
leave box

repeat


-----------

'follow the line'

IF left and right sensors low(/high, depends on the definition)-> go straight

IF left sensor activated -> turn left untill the sensor deactivates
IF two left sensors activated -> turn left sharper untill the sensor deactivates

IF right sensor activated -> turn right untill the sensor deactivates
IF two right sensors activated -> turn right sharper untill sensor deactivates

IF all sensors get deactivated turn in big circles to find the line 

IF perpendicular to the line (all sensors deactivated) depending on the desired 
direction (mapping turn left/right)

IF object detected -> turn around and find another path (detour)

States: forward, turn_left, turn_left_sharp, turn_right, turn_right_sharp, rotate_left,
rotate_right, find line, detour

-----------

IF the boxes are found - pick the box up 
IF destination is reached - leave the box

States: take_the_box, leave_the_box

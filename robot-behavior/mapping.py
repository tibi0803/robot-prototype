#To define the track in the code, you can create a class or a data structure to represent the track. 
#Here's an example of how you can do it in Python:

class Track:
    def __init__(self, points):
        self.points = points

    def get_point(self, index):
        return self.points[index]

    def get_number_of_points(self):
        return len(self.points)

# Example usage
track_points = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]
track = Track(track_points)

#In this example, the Track class has a list of points that represent the track. 
#You can add more methods to the class to perform operations on the track, 
#such as getting the distance between two points or finding the closest point to the 
#robot's current position.

#To allow the robot to choose different routes, you can create multiple instances of 
#the Track class, each representing a different route. You can then use the robot's 
#encoders to determine its current position and orientation, and use this information 
#to select the appropriate track to follow.

#Here's an example of how you can use the Track class to allow the robot to choose 
#different routes:

# Create multiple tracks
track1_points = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]
track2_points = [(9, 10), (11, 12), (13, 14), (15, 16)]
track1 = Track(track1_points)
track2 = Track(track2_points)

# Determine the robot's current position and orientation
current_position = (0, 0)
current_orientation = 0

# Select the appropriate track based on the robot's current position and orientation
if current_position == (0, 0) and current_orientation == 0:
    track = track1
else:
    track = track2

# Follow the selected track
for i in range(track.get_number_of_points()):
    point = track.get_point(i)
    # Move the robot to the next point on the track
    move_robot_to_point(point)

#In this example, the robot selects the appropriate track based on its current position
# and orientation. You can modify the selection criteria to suit your specific needs.
